                data={<>    <p>The modern world has equipped itself digitally. Businesses and organizations around the
                    world have understood the value that lies in the digital platform. They are making more and
                    more efforts to reach their customers on it. They have realized the fact that digital platforms
                    are the real future deeply. The competitive corporate world knows very well that the winners
                    of the future marketplace will be those who control the most eyeballs on the digital platforms.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change from traditional markets to the current market is that companies around
                        the world have learned that Digital Marketing cannot be taken as a mere optional strategy.
                        The growth rate of the digital industry is expected to be 32% CAGR in India alone. The global
                        expenditure of organization’s budgets on Digital marketing is projected to increase by as
                        much as 200%. Thus it can be easily seen that the demand for skilled Digital marketers will
                        grow exponentially in the coming years. One of the companies’ primary desires will be to
                        ensure that their marketing budgets are utilized efficiently and effectively instead of being
                        misspent and wasted away without any significant returns on investment. For this purpose
                        they will require many skilled and experienced Digital marketers who know their way around
                        the many intricacies and nuances of various digital platforms, creating a need for popular
                        <strong>Digital Marketing Certification Training</strong> courses.</p>
                    <p>Thus it can be logically concluded that the scope for Digital marketers is going to expand
                        tremendously in the coming years. For a fresher who desires to enter the field of Digital
                        marketing or for a working professional already present in the field who desires to sharpen his
                        skills and expand his knowledge, an excellent and comprehensive certification course is
                        required. Careerera’s <strong>PGP in Digital Marketing</strong> course wholly fulfills that requirement.</p></>}
