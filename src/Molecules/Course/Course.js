                          A : Data science is a field to unify data analysis, statistics, and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of statistics, computer science, mathematics, domain knowledge and information science. The field involves extracting, visualizing, analyzing, storing, and managing data to create insights. These insights assist the companies in making effective data-driven decisions.

                          Every organization needs to evaluate and analyze data to fathom sales performance, marketing focus, customer behaviour, operational performance, and so on. In the case of financial service companies, banks, e-commerce companies, manufacturing units, and healthcare companies, the leaders seek to derive useful and incisive insights from all the data they have collected over the years. All these companies are assembling Data Science teams or hiring Data Science consultants to resolve their business issues or identify new opportunities which they can exploit. Data is becoming more and more important each day and so are Data Scientist or Data Analyst roles.

                          A : Data Science is in huge demand in many industries, ranging from IT to Finance to Ecommerce to Manufacturing to Healthcare to Retail. It is the fastest growing job on Linkedin and is predicted to create 11.5 million jobs by 2026. This makes Data Science a very lucrative career choice. Also, the number of people who actually possess the requisite skillsets to become a complete Data Scientist is very little. Thus, there is a high demand of Data Scientists but a low supply of qualified people. So Data Scientists can demand as big a salary as they want and the companies will have to comply with their demands.
